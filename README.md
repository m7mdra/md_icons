# md_icons
The `md_icons` repository hosts a comprehensive collection of Material Design-inspired icons for Flutter applications. It consists of three projects, `mdi`, `mdil`, and an `example` project showcasing all available icons.


## Module
#### [mdi](https://github.com/m7mdra/md_icons/tree/main/mdi)

The mdi project contains the primary set of Material Design icons following the standard guidelines.
#### [mdil](https://github.com/m7mdra/md_icons/tree/main/mdil)

The mdil project houses the light or outline versions of icons, providing a subtler appearance compared to the regular icons.
#### [Example](https://github.com/m7mdra/md_icons/tree/main/example) 

The example project demonstrates how to utilize and display all available icons from both mdi and mdil. It serves as a reference for using these icons in Flutter applications and showcases their visual representations.
