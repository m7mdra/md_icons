# md_icons
The `md_icons` repository hosts a comprehensive collection of Material Design-inspired icons for Flutter applications. It consists of three projects, `mdi`, `mdil`, and an `example` project showcasing all available icons.


## Projects
#### mdi

The mdi project contains the primary set of Material Design icons following the standard guidelines.
#### mdil

The mdil project houses the light or outline versions of icons, providing a subtler appearance compared to the regular icons.
#### Example Project

The example project demonstrates how to utilize and display all available icons from both mdi and mdil. It serves as a reference for using these icons in Flutter applications and showcases their visual representations.
